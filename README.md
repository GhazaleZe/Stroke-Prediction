# Stroke-Prediction  
this project contains a full knowledge discovery path on stroke prediction dataset. list of steps in this path are as below:  
1. exploratory data analysis available in P2.ipynb  
2. data preprocessing (takeing care of missing data, outliers, etc.) available in preparation.ipynb
3. preparing two new datasets of cleaned data, one for people 18 to 90 years old and for 18 to 75 years old available in preparation.ipynb  
4. training and testing models available in models.ipynb  
5. evaluation and error analysis available in models.ipynb  
we hope to help people in danger of brain stroke, so far based on this dataset we can inform 83% of stroke victims beforehand.
